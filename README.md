# GF2Matrix
Cython implementation of a matrix with entries from GF(2).

## Curent Functionality
  * Basic matrix operation of matrices up to 64*64
  * computation of Rank

## To add:
  * Support for larger matrices
  * More complex operations, such as LUP Decomposition and Guassian Elimination

## Dependancies:
  * Cython
  * numpy
